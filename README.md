TASK - EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS USING PYTHON

Perform 'Exploratory Data Anlaysis' on dataset 'SampleSuperStore'

As a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where you can work to make more profit.

Hereby I have created an analysis model of a SuperStore dataset given by the company and have deployed the parameters successfully.

Also, I have given some useful insights to get a clear idea about the SuperStore sales, discount and profit in ship mode, state, city, region, category
and sub-category
